A typing game with quotes from various authors.

Running the program with the name of the author as argument:

</p>



Running the program with no arguments promts the user to type the name of the author:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ArisPagonopoulos/typing_game/blob/main/demo2.gif"/>
</p>

Or you can run the program with the argument "-author random" to get a quote from a random author.
