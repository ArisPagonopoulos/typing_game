A typing game with quotes from various authors.
It webscraps the site azquotes.com for quotes and lets the user exercise his typing skills with them.

Running the program with the name of the author as argument:

</p>



Running the program with no arguments promts the user to type the name of the author:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ArisPagonopoulos/typing_game/blob/main/demo2.gif"/>
</p>

Or you can run the program with the argument "-author random" to get a quote from a random author.
